Discription of game: 
Inversal jump is going to start from the center of the earth, you are going to have to go up from the bottom all the way to the top of the earth (Mount Everest), after that we get transported to the moon where we get some kind of space suit, once we reach the limit of the moon we start from the lowest point in mars and have to climb up platforms and wall to reach a spaceship which allows us to travel to new custom planets with the same concept but with different features like lava, ice, different gravity etcâ€¦Just to make each level interesting, at the end of each level; there’s going to be a mini boss fight to earn rewards, and once a month there’s going to be a “Ultimate” Boss, which is going to be a hard boss but you can get rare cosmetics and in game currency and a badge saying you defeated it. We will also feature top of the line parkour features like wall jumping, wall climbing physics etc. We will also have extensive physics for our jumping mechanics.
